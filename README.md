# DAOBOX - decentralized governance for legacy non-profits

## Why

## Who
Non-profit associations for whom digital sovereignty is important and who want to be able to act as an association in a scalable but binding manner in the "New Normal".
## How
DAOBOX is the 1st software hub that enables legacy non-profits to verifiably attest that legally required acts (as per the by-laws of the non-profit association) have taken place at specified dates, such as
*association meetings with an attendence quorum
*binding votes during such sessions

Furthermore, DAOBOX enables legacy (non-digital) associations to **scale up** their decision making by using governance tools developed in the dGov industry like conviction voting and other formalized voting mechanisms that enable a) voting to be free of pressures of in-person voting b) stretch out over time allowing for more in-depth decision making c) recording the results with ease.
